Items to do:

  - Reparameterise functions, have them as either strings or functions. If supply "odds_ratio"
    then the main function will run a closure on the outcome variable to generate the
    function parameterised as just (var, data) as required
  - Allow a second cross-reference variable
  - Add summary statistics, such as chisq
  - Printing to excel function (text only)
  - Printing to rtf (with table structure)
  - Printing to HTML (with table structure)
  - Printing to latex (with table structure)
