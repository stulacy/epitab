\title{Builds a contingency table}
\usage{
contingency_table(independents, data, outcomes = NULL,
  crosstab_funcs = NULL, row_funcs = NULL, col_funcs = NULL,
  frequency = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{independents}{A named list of independent variables, which will
be distributed down the table's rows. The variables must be specified
by strings, with the item name used as the column header.}

\item{data}{The data set that contains the columns specified in
\code{cat_vars} and \code{outcome}.}

\item{outcomes}{The variables to cross-tabulate by. These will be
distributed across the table's columns. Specified as a named list of strings.
Must correspond to factor or character variables.}

\item{crosstab_funcs}{A list of functions that are applied to every cross-tabulation
permutation of \code{independents} and \code{outcomes}. The most common
function, the frequency, is provided with the package in function \code{freq}.
See the vignette for further guidance.}

\item{row_funcs}{A list of functions that are applied row-wise to the table,
one independent variable at a time, providing a value for each level of
the factors specified in \code{independents}.
Two functions: \code{odds_ratio} and \code{hazard_ratio} come
provided with the package.
See the vignette for further guidance.}

\item{col_funcs}{A list of functions that are applied column-wise to the table,
to every outcome separate from the independent variables.
Examples provided with the package included \code{summary_mean} and
\code{summary_median}, which calculate the mean and median value of a
specificed continuous variable for each level of the outcome.
See the vignette for further guidance.}

\item{frequency}{Whether to include the counts of each level of \code{cat_vars}.}
}
\value{
An S3 object of class \code{contintab}, that provides the cell contents
  as a matrix of strings.
}
\description{
A contingency table summarises a data set with multiple categorical variables
in many ways. There is generally an outcome variable of interest, and the
independent variables will be cross-tabulated with this outcome. Summary statistics
are also often provided, along with the results of models fitting a relationship
between the covariates and the outcome.
}
\details{
This function builds up a contingency table to summarise a data set, which
can later be exported in a publication friendly format.
